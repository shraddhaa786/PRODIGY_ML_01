# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model. The dataset used contains various features related to the properties, and the goal is to understand how different attributes, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, impact the sale price of the houses.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Develop a predictive model to estimate house prices based on selected features.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
- Visualize the results to better understand the relationship between actual and predicted prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `Dataset` folder. It contains the following relevant features:
- **GrLivArea**: Above ground living area in square feet.
- **BedroomAbvGr**: Number of bedrooms above ground.
- **FullBath**: Number of full bathrooms.
- **SalePrice**: The sale price of the house (target variable).
